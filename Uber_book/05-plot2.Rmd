# Visualizations with Simple Features {#viz_2}

Now that we have an idea of the content of our dataset, we can focus on its geospatial aspect.


## Merge the data (again)

We first merge our `DT.max.speed.per.way.hour` table with the OSM shapefile :
```{r}
df.Uber <- as.data.frame(DT.max.speed.per.way.hour[,name:=NULL])
OSM_sf.with.Uber <-  merge(OSM_sf,df.Uber,by.x='osm_id',by.y='osm_id',all.y=T)
```

Note that in order to merge both, we must convert our data.table `DT.max.speed.per.way.hour` to a data.frame.  

Can we resist to look at the Uber data for the streets (ways) that are defined as 'pedestrian' ?

No.

```{r}
OSM_sf.with.Uber %>% filter(fclass=='pedestrians')
```
A very clean dataset indeed, not a single row  for ways defined by OSM as pedestrian.

How about the other types of ways ? We aggregate the data per `class` and compute the mean of the speed limit infrigment ratio :
```{r}
DT.OSM.max.speed <-  as.data.table(OSM_sf.with.Uber)
DT.OSM.max.speed[,.(total_fclass=.N, mean_ratio.over =round(mean(ratio.over),2)),by=.(fclass)][order(-mean_ratio.over)]
```
In term of occurence, _motorways_ are the most likely to witness speed limit infrigments.


## Create an animation with the `magick` package :

With the shapefile enriched with our aggregated Uber data, we have a glance into it:
```{r}
plot(subset(OSM_sf.with.Uber,hour==5)["total_rows"],col='darkblue',main='Rides at 5am')
```
Nice, but we also want to represent the frequency of those rides per way.
For this, we set a new variable `col` that use the quantiles of the `total_rows` to set the color :
```{r}
col <- findColours(classIntervals(
            OSM_sf.with.Uber$total_rows, 4, style="quantile"),
            smoothColors("tomato",98,"white"))
```

Now try again with this `col` variable :
```{r}
plot(subset(OSM_sf.with.Uber,hour==5)["total_rows"],col=col,main='Rides at 5am with quantiles color')
```
How about adding a black background ?
```{r}
plot(subset(OSM_sf.with.Uber,hour==5)["total_rows"],col=col,main='Rides at 5am with quantiles colors and black background',bgc='black')
```

Ok, now we can write a methode to loop on each hour of the day, plot the map, and save it into a file :

Before that, we must adjust the geographical boundaries of each plot so that, when combined, they fit on the same rectangle :

```{r}
# we create a new sf object to freeze the boundaries while looping on the hour :
bb <- st_bbox(OSM_sf.with.Uber)
print(bb)
a = st_sf( geom = st_sfc(st_point(c(bb$xmin,bb$ymin)), st_point(c(bb$xmax,bb$ymax))), crs = 4326)
```

And now our looping method :
__uncomment the code to make it run__
```{r}
#
# for (i in unique(OSM_sf.with.Uber$hour)){
#   png(paste0('plot/',as.character(i),"_rplot.png") )
#   plot(a,axes=F,col='black',reset=F,bgc='black',main=paste0('Average Uber rides at ',stringr::str_pad(i,2,'left','0'),'H'))
#   plot(subset(OSM_sf.with.Uber,hour==i)["total_rows"],add=T,axes=F,col=col)
#   dev.off()
# }
```


Once we have our 24 plots saved into files in the `plot` folder (make sure it exists before), we call the method to load those images, combine them and generate an animated gif :

```{r}
createAnimation <- function() {
  listfiles <-
    paste0('plot/', sort(unique(OSM_sf.with.Uber$hour)), "_rplot.png")
  images <- lapply(listfiles , image_read)
  frames <- image_morph(image_join(images) , frames = 10)
  animation <- image_animate(frames, fps = 2)
  image_write(animation, "plot/Uber_total_rows.gif")
}
```


The call to this method is commented as it is relatively long to process:
```{r}
#createAnimation()
```

And here is the final result :

![Uber](plot/Uber_total_rows.gif)
